## SELF-TAUGHT STUDIES

As a passionate IT professional, I have dedicated significant time and effort to self-learning and continuously expanding my knowledge base. Throughout my career, I have taken the initiative to acquire hands-on expertise in several advanced technologies, including:

- **CI/CD and DevOps Practices:**  
  I have actively studied and practiced Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes. This includes configuring and managing pipelines for automated testing and deployment, using tools such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI. I have applied these practices in real-world scenarios, deploying mobile applications to both iOS and Android platforms using GitHub Release and TestFlight (for iOS), ensuring seamless automation and efficient deployment. 🔄

- **Docker and Containers:**  
  I have developed deep knowledge in containerization and orchestration, particularly with Docker. I have worked on dockerizing both applications and infrastructure, optimizing the deployment and scalability of services. My experience includes creating Dockerfiles, managing Docker Compose for multi-container applications, and integrating Docker with CI/CD pipelines to automate workflows. 🐳

- **AWS and Cloud Computing:**  
  Through extensive self-learning, I have become proficient in AWS services, including EC2, S3, Lambda, and CloudFormation. I’ve completed various certifications such as AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner and AWS Technology: Cloud Essentials, which have enhanced my cloud infrastructure design and management skills. I have hands-on experience in deploying and managing scalable and resilient applications in the cloud, including configuring load balancing, security, and monitoring. ☁️

- **Automation Tools (Ansible, Bash, Python):**  
  I have gained experience in automating repetitive tasks and infrastructure management using tools like Ansible, Bash scripting, and Python. I have written scripts to automate server provisioning, configuration management, and deployment processes, improving efficiency and reducing manual intervention in daily operations. ⚙️

- **Monitoring and Observability:**  
  I have explored monitoring tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, and Zabbix to monitor application performance and infrastructure health. Through self-learning, I’ve configured custom dashboards and alerts, ensuring the reliability and availability of services across various environments. 📊

These self-directed learning initiatives have not only expanded my technical skill set but also shaped my problem-solving abilities
